Design draft


Repeat for all bins:
* Input s,b,n for one bin -> get CL for one bin


Determine what level we need a CL value for.
Possible levels: Overall / per Category / per Analysis / per Observable / per Bin

For the chosen level, decide which bins play a role, determine if they're correlated or not

If correlated: keep only stronger CL

If not, re-alculate combined CL from [s1,s2,...],[b1,b2,...],[n1,n2,...]


=========

Ideally all this wrapped in command line tool and single function call API, so that end users can scan one point at a time easily.

get_CL(yoda_s,yoda_b,yoda_n, level='Overall') --> CL value

======

Need translation frm YODA format into [s,b,n] format we use.
