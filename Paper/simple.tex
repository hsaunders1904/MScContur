\begin{abstract}
The Large Hadron Collider is probing physics in a new kinematic region, at energies around and above the 
electroweak symmetry-breaing scale. Many searches for signatures of physics beyond the Standard Model have 
been performed, and extensive measurements of various final states have also been 
carried out. At time of writing, the results are generally in accord with Standard Model expectations, 
notwithstanding a few currently marginal anomalies. Whether physics beyond the Standard Model is discovered 
or not, there is a need to extract the clearest and most generic information about physics in this new energy regime,
an imperative which will grow with integrated luminosity. The framework of so-called 'simplified models', coupled
with the fact that model-depedence in many LHC measurements is minimal, allows strong constraints on new physics 
models to be placed, using existing and future measurements. We demontrate the power of this approach using a competitive 
simplified Dark Matter model. The method is highly scaleable to other models of further measurements, as they appear.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

With the discovery of the Higgs boson~\cite{Aad:2012tfa,Chatrchyan:2012ufa}, 
the first data-taking period of the experiments at the 
Large Hadron Collider demonstrated that the understanding of electroweak symmetry-breaking within
the Standard Model (SM) is broadly correct, and thus that the theory is potentially valid well above the
TeV scale. Many precision measurements of jets, charged leptons, and other of final states, 
have been published, reaching into this new kinematic domain. The predictions of the SM are 
generally in agreement with the data, while the many dedicated searches for physics beyond the SM
have excluded a wide range of possible scenarios. Nevertheless, there are many reasons to be confident that
physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) exists; examples include the graiational evidence for Dark Matter, the large 
preponderance of matter over antimatter in the universe, and the existence of gravity itself. None of 
these can be easily accommodated within known Standard Model phenomenology. 

This motivates a continued campaign to make precise measurements and calculations at higher energies and 
luminosities, and to exploit these measurements to narrow down the class of viable models of new physics, 
hopefully shedding light on the correct new theory, or at least on the energy scale at which
new physics might be observed at future experiments.

In this paper we exploit three important developments to survey existing measurements and set 
limits on new physics. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item
SM predictions for differential and exclusive, or semi-exclusive, final states are made using sophisticated 
calculational software, often embedded in Monte Carlo generators capable of simulating full, realistic final 
states~\cite{Buckley:2011ms}. These generators now incorporate higher-order processes
matched to logarithmic parton showers and successful models of soft physics such as hadronisation and
underlying event. They are also capable of importing new physics models into this framework, thus allowing
rapid predictions of their impact on a wide variety of final states simultaneously. 
In this paper we make extensive use of these capabilities within Herwig~\cite{Bahr:2008pv}.
\item
As many favoured BSM scenarios have been excluded, there has been a move toward 
``simplified models'' of new physics~\cite{Alves:2011wf,Abercrombie:2015wmb}, which aim to be as generic as possible, 
while being internally consistent. The philosophy is similar to an ``effective lagrangian'' approach in which effective
couplings are introduced to describe new physics, but is more powerful as such simplified models also
include new particles, and thus can remain useful up to and beyond the scale of new physics - a region 
potentially probed by LHC measurements.
\item
The precision measurements from the LHC have mostly been made in a manner which minimises their model-dependence. 
That is, they are defined in terms of final-state signatures in fiducial regions well matched to the
acceptance of the detector. The majority of such measurements are readily available for analysis and
comparison in the Rivet library~\cite{Buckley:2010ar}. 
\end{enumerate}

These three developments together make it possible to efficiently 
bring the power of a very wide range of data to bear on the search for new physics. While such a generic approach is
unlikely to compete in terms of speed and sensitivity with a search optimisied for a specific theory, the breadth
of potential signatures and models which can be covered makes it a powerful complementary approach. Any theory seeking
to explain a new signature or anomaly in the data may have consequences for other final states which should be checked 
against data this way. If no BSM physics emerges, a model-dependent and systematic approach becomes mandatory.

The outline of the paper is as follows. In the next section, we motivate and describe the 
simplified model we consider as a first demonstration, and its implementation via Herwig. 
In Section~\ref{sec:measurements} we introduce the measurements that we will use, and their implementation in Rivet. 
Section~\ref{sec:kinematics} discusses the differential cross sections in which the impact of these models would be 
most apparent. In Section~\ref{sec:limits} this impact is translated into limits on the model parameters.
