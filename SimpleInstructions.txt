THIS IS NOT AN EXECUTABLE SCRIPT IT IS MEANT TO BE USED AS A README FILE.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Log onto plus1 UCL > then to a PC
source /unix/cedar/software/sl6/Herwig-7.1.0/setupEnv.sh
#checkout code and source setup file in top level of svn
source setupContur.sh


-----------------------------------------

# Also need to build the modified analyses:

cd
$CONTURMODULEDIR/modified_analyses/Analyses
chmod +x buildrivet  # only need to do this once after checkout from svn.
./buildrivet.sh


# and build the database of static analysis information

cd $CONTURMODULEDIR
make

# if the make step does not work you may need to install sqlite3
# and re-run make again
# Note also that if you run CLTest/CLTestSingle before making the DB, sqlite will
# create an empty analysis.db file which you will probably then have to remove 
# in order for make to build the correct one properly.


-----------------------------------------

# Copy the run area to a test folder.
cp -r $CONTURMODULEDIR/AnalysisTools/GridSetup mytestfolder

-----------------------------------------

# In the standard run area we have two simplified models installed as default. 

DM_vector_mediator_UFO is the model used in the first contur paper.
DM_vector_mediator_HF_UFO is the same model but with Z' coupling to all generations of quark.

# The next instructions are specific to running Herwig with one of these models, a recommended 
# first step. If you are running a different model or generator, you'll have to modify your
# actions here; for a single run, once you have the yoda file from rivet, the procedure should be the same again

# For convenience, we have two ways of running, specific to the simple DM model but can be modified
# Example Herwig .in files are provided in the model directories; see the comments in there.

# First Way: (see for example .in files with HAD in the name)   - runs inclusive generation of BSM particles.
# Second Way: (see for example .in files with WEAK in the name) - forces associated production modes of weak bosons, 
#                                                                 and leptonic decays of those bosons.

-----------------------------------------

# At end of these .in files theres a line like:
set LHCGenerator:EventHandler:LuminosityFunction:Energy 7000.0
read 7_WEAK.ana

# This sets the CoM energy, and loads the relevant rivet analyses in the .ana files
# The .ana files are in the GridPack folder copied over.
# To add a new analysis, you need to add it to your .ana file, but also update the tables in
# $CONTURMODULEDIR/AnalysisTools/contur/contur/TestingFunctions
# making sure you provide the necessary info about the lumi, the class of final state, and so on.

-----------------------------------------


# To make a run on a single set of analyses, single beam energy, single model point
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cd GridPack
# Get one of the example Herwig .in files
cp DM_vector_mediator_HF_UFO/hf-1000-600-7_WEAK.in TestRun.in

# Bulld the FRModel.model file for Herwig
ufo2herwig DM_vector_mediator_HF_UFO && make

-----------------------------------------

#Build the Herwig runcard
Herwig read TestRun.in

#Generate the events and pipe straight through rivet
Herwig run LHC.run -N 2000

-----------------------------------------

#Run the single test script on the output yoda
CLTestSingle LHC.yoda

#prints
Combined CL: 0.743664
Based on 11 found counting tests

More details output to ANALYSIS folder

# Also makes a plots directory containing all the .dat files for the analyses scanned

To build the pdf files of these plots, run

contur-mkhtml

from the same directory in which you ran CLTestSingle. This will build the plots and html index
pages in ./contur-plots

----------------------------------------

# Todo a batch run to make a grid,
cd ..
#Back to the base directory copied over

emacs BatchSubmitHad.py

#make sure the two sourced files are in the right location, and change the grid size, granularity in the for loop

#outputs a folder structure like
cd /unix/atlas4/yallup/ConturGrids/gq05/gq05had_7/

#To build the heatmaps, in this directory run
YodaMerger

#To merge all the output yodas and
CLTest

#To do the analysis and output a folder ANALYSIS
cd ANALYSIS

PlotMaker

#to make the heatmaps
